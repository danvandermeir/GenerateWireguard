Quick start:
1) Run (optional, but recommend non-standard port: " --port <PORT>"):
	$WGSCRIPTPATH$WGSCRIPTNAME --endpoint <FQDN> --port <PORT> -LGpp <CLIENTNAME1> <CLIENTNAME2>
2) Securely give client file to client for import or use with wg-quick.


Wireguard was built with peer to peer relationships.
This tool is used to generate a server and client style relationship for Wireguard interfaces.
Effectively, this is a client manager.
When script is called server and client configuration files in wg-quick format will be generated.
Endpoint will be configured for clients to connect as requested.
Edit options in either the CLI as described below, or by editing script variables.

Old server configuration file will be copied to /etc/wireguard/<INTERFACE>.conf.old
Old client configuration files will be replaced, but should not remain on disk after secure transmission to clients!
All names must be alphanumeric, period (.), minus (-), or underscore (_) with a maximum of 63 characters.

Options:
	-L				make changes live
	-i				use this endpoint Wireguard interface name
						preference order: -i name, script variable (IFACE), script name (generatewg_<IFACE>), or generate unused wg0-wg255
	--iface			change endpoint Wireguard interface name
	-p				list client(s) setup and status if no other operations requested, one client name per iteration
	-P				list all clients setups and status if no other operations requested
	-G				generate new configuration for client(s)
						preference towards client specific settings (--dns, --mtu, disabled status, and routes)
	-D				disable client(s)
	-E				enable client(s)
	-R				remove client(s)


Client configurations will be regenerated, and clients will require these new configuration files:
	--endpoint		endpoint hostname/IP clients connect to
						if hostname ommited at inception script will attempt to find WAN IP
						if IP is used and IP changes clients will require configuration file update (script run with -PGL options)
	--port			endpoint port clients connect to
						if ommited at inception uses first unused port from 51820 and ascends
	--gateway-on	route "all" client traffic through endpoint
						if ommited at inception this is disabled
	--gateway-off	do not route "all" client traffic through endpoint
						if ommited at inception this is enabled


Client configurations may need to be regenerated, and clients will require these new configuration files:
	--network		CIDR address and network for endpoint Wireguard interface (192.168.0.1/24)
						if ommited at inception a suitable network will be generated from --lan network
	--ip-beg, --ip-end
					client IP range begining and ending
						if ommited at inception starts ascending from --network address and ends at --network address, loops
	--lan			the endpoint system interface that client traffic will be routed to if configured by isolation and gateway settings
						if ommited at inception this will be the system defafult gateway interface
	--unisolate, --isolate
					do or do not route --lan network traffic to/from clients through endpoint
						applied to specific clients via -P or -p options, otherwise acts as server default
						if ommited at inception this is unisolated
	--route-add, --route-rem
					add or remove CIDR address (192.168.0.1/32) or network (192.168.0.0/24) to be routed, one per iteration
						applied to specific clients via -P or -p options, otherwise acts as server default
						when made live if --lan interface is unisolated specified client(s) or server will be granted access
	--dns			DNS server address
						applied to specific clients via -P or -p options, otherwise acts as server default
						if ommited at inception this is empty
	--dns-on, --dns-off
					do or do not force clients to use DNS server
						applied to specific clients via -P or -p options, otherwise acts as server default
						if ommited at inception this is off

	--mtu			Maximum Transmission Unit size
						applied to specific clients via -P or -p options, otherwise acts as server default
						if ommited this allows wg-quick to configure out the MTU
